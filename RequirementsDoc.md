## 1. Introduction 

### 1.1 Purpose

* The primary purpose for this ATFW is to automate the testing process of a real-estate website, minimising human effort, maximising effeiciency and reliability of testing processes.

### 1.2 Scope

* Testing coverage blankets:
    1. User Authentication - Making sure users are registered and log in with valid credentials
    2. User Posts - Making sure only registered users are able to list properties, that the listed property meets the required standard and includes the necessary details.
    3. Scraped Data - Correctly scrape property information, while also being able to discard of unwanted data debris.

    6. Cross Browser compatibility - Ensure that the site is compatible with multiple browsers.
    7. Load testing - To observe the site performence under lot of traffic and ensure that it can hold up when or if pushed to load limit.
    8. Security testing - Ensure basic security against malpractices such as SQL Injections, XSS.
    9. Cross-Device Testing- testing the website's functionality on various devices (desktop, mobile, tablet).
    10. Testing the website's support for multiple languages and regions.
    11. Error Handling and Validation -checking how the website handles errors, input validation, and error messages.
    12. Performance Testing
    13. Ensuring that recent code changes do not negatively impact existing functionalities.
    14. Reporting and Logging - providing detailed reports on test results and logging for debugging purposes.
